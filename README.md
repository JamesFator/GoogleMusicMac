GoogleMusicMac (Plex Player)
==============

Wrapper originally created for Google Music that turns All Access into a separate app that is compatible with the Mac's media keys.

This branch is an adaptation that works with the Plex.tv web interface.

Created by James Fator. No association with Google Inc. or Plex.tv this is merely a utility to fill a need.
